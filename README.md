# Fundamental, an EmulationStation theme with video support
Fundamental is a EmulationStation theme targeted for use on the Raspberry Pi based on my BigBox theme by the same name (https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/265-fundamental-theme/). It supports video snaps on RetroPie thanks to the work of fieldofcows (https://github.com/fieldofcows). You can read more about his ongoing implementation on the RetroPie forums.
