# Fundamental, an EmulationStation theme by Grila
Fundamental is a EmulationStation theme targeted for use on the Raspberry Pi. The design is based on my BigBox theme by the same name (https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/265-fundamental-theme/). This theme supports all the new features of EmulationStation that have been added into the RetroPie build (video snaps, themeable system carousel, etc.).
